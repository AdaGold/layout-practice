# Layout Practice Exercise

In this exercise you will take an existing site and apply Grid & Flexbox to it to lay the content out in a readable and modern manner.

## Step 1:  Livecode

Your instructor will demonstrate how to lay out the navigation menu using the Grid and Flexbox systems.

## Step 2:  Team Practice

In teams of 3-4, you will style the given site to create a modern, readable, and functional layout.

You should:

- Use at least one Flex Container
- Use at least one Grid Container

There is an existing css class called `"grid"` which suggests a candidate for a grid container.

The footer and top menu also make great candidates for use as Flex Containers.
